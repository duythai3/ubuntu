Permissions of Users on Ubuntu Notes

1. Why Do We Need Permissions

	Each user has their own home directory and some areas are shared while others are
	locked
	The three permissions include: Read(look inside it), Write(Change it), and Execute
	(run it like a program)

2. The three types of permissions

	Read(r) - open and read file
	Write(w) - change the file/folder
	Execute(x) - run file like a script or enter a folder

3. The three groups of people

	User(u) - The owner of the file
	Group(g) - A group of users (like teammates)
	Others(o) - Everyone else

4. Seeing permissions

	type ls -l to see permissions
	-rwxr-xr--
	- means its a file
	- rwx r-x r--
	first three character is user permission, the second is group permissions, the
	third is others permssion.
	r = read, w = write, x = execute

5. Changing permissions

	chmod command to change permissions
	chmod u(user)+x(execute) file.txt = giving user permission to execute file.txt
	chmod o-w file.txt = removing others' writing permission on file.txt
	chmod a+rw file.txt =giving everybody writing and reading permission on file.txt

6. Numeric Shortcut Permissions

	4 = read
	2 = write
	1 = execute

	7 = rwx
	6 = rw-
	5 = r-x
	4 = r--

	chmod 410 file.txt = chmod r----x--- file.txt

7. Ownership

	Each file has owner and group
	check with ls -l
	change owner with sudo chown(changeowner) newuser file.txt
	change group with sudo chgrp(changegroup) newgroup file.txt
